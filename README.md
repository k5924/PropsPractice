## About The Project

This app was made to teach me how to use props in react. After using this, I realized that the syntax is similar to the way parameters and arguements are passed around in flutter however, as it is javascript you dont have to specify a data type and you dont need to include the required keyword

## Built With

This section list any major frameworks that you built your project using.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
